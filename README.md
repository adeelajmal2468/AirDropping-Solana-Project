# AirDropping-Solana-Project

In this project, I have created a solana wallet first and then extract the wallets credentials and then check the balance of the wallet and then airdrop some amount into the Solana Wallet.

The Pre-requisites required to run this project are:

1. IDE (Integrated Development Environment) like VS Code.
2. Node.js and NPM

First of all create a directory where you need to store this project.Then run npm install --save @solana/web3.js on cmd if you are using windows.

To run this code use command: node index.js.
